# Enron_Fraud_Project

[**Project Report**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/PetzMcPetz/Enron_Fraud_Project/blob/main/final_project/Enron_Project_v2.html)

The project report shows the html export of the jupyter notebook *Enron_Project_v2.ipynb*.
Please note that the poi_id_v2.py contains only functions which are imported and used in Enron_Project_v2.ipynb.  
All code works properly in the jupyter notebook.  
Relevant functions for storing final data and testing the classifier are also imported into the notebook and working properly.  
Alternativly i have also uploaded test_script_enron_v2.py which is identical as the notebook.
